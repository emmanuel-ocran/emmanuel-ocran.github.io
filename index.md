I’m **Emmanuel Ocran**, a data analyst and cloud enthusiast based in Ghana. I work at the intersection of **data, cloud, and AI**, using tools like Python, SQL, AWS, and Power BI to solve practical problems across finance, NGOs, and tech.

This site is a place where I share:
- My [projects](/projects/) in data analysis, AI/ML, and web development
- Occasional [writings](/posts/) on what I’m learning
- My [background and resume](/about/) for those interested in working together

I’m especially interested in how data and technology can be applied in:
- Financial services and credit access  
- NGO impact measurement  
- Automation in small business decision-making

If you’re a recruiter, data professional, or collaborator, feel free to [contact me](/contact/) or connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-ocran).
