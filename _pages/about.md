Hi, I’m **Emmanuel Ocran** — a data analyst with a background in finance and growing expertise in cloud analytics, data storytelling, and business insight.

I’ve always been fascinated by how numbers tell stories. This passion led me to study finance, where I discovered the power of data to drive meaningful decisions. While completing my BCom in Finance, I took courses in *Computer Applications in Finance* and *Financial Modeling*, where I used **Python** to analyze financial data and forecast stock prices — laying the foundation for my transition into data.

Since then, I’ve immersed myself in the world of data science and analytics, learning to transform raw data into insights that businesses and nonprofits can use to solve real problems. I work with tools like **Python**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**, and I’m **AWS Certified** — applying cloud services like **S3**, **Athena**, and **Lambda** to streamline data workflows and reporting.

Outside of analysis, I’ve also worked as a freelance **WordPress developer**, building digital platforms for mission-driven organizations. This experience sharpened my user-centered thinking and technical versatility.

Right now, I’m building hands-on projects in **operations**, **finance**, and **education** — combining data visualization, cloud integration, and strong communication to deliver value. I document my learning through **Data Notes**, a blog where I share practical lessons, tools, and career reflections for aspiring data professionals.

When I’m not coding or building dashboards, I enjoy **peer discussion**, **technical writing**, and exploring how **AI/ML** can improve financial systems and social outcomes.
